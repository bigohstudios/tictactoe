SSDs marketed for HD replacement do not need noatime.  They have re-write=20
limits such that, if written to at maximum speed for the lifetime of a=20
comparable HD, less than the number of reserved cells would fail and no dat=
a=20
would be lost.  They are roughly 1.5 orders of magnitude more durable than=
=20
"thumbdrives" -- they have to be to stand a MS Windows page file or a Linux=
=20
swap partition/file.

noatime can increase performance, it does so by breaking the expectations o=
f=20
at least mutt (possibly others).  atime updates are a normal expectation,=20
since they've been included in the documentation of dozens of UNIX system=20
calls since before standardization started on POSIX.

relatime is a much better alternative and is roughly equivalent to the OS=20
deciding to combine atime updates, which is explicitly allowed by the=20
standards.

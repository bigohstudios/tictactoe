This is enough to use grub2 for new installing of Debian.

And these problems say, we still need an alternative - I would say: LiLO.

But not all kernels are to large - especially the custom kernels - and
LiLO can be used for this special situation. Until which size of kernel=20
is LiLO usable?

My suggestion / recommendation is now:

  a) using grub2 as default boot manager for new installations (d-i)
     and for updating grub.

  b) provide LiLO in squeeze as alternative for grub2. The
     limitations must be said while installing the lilo package.
     I think it must not be a proposal in d-i.

Because I still use LiLO for all my systems, I could support the
maintaining of LiLO. Would this a way for you, William?

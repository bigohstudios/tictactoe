Hello,

I have just spoken with an UUnet technician at 11:23 PDT and he was unable
to provide me with any new information regarding the outage.  He did
confirm that problems had spread beyond the east coast and are now seen
nationwide through out their network.  They are currently working with
their hardware vendor to try and isolate the issue.

A large number of Internap's connections to UUnet remain shutdown and
traffic is being routed over alternate providers.  The scale of this
outage is causing a large number of peering points with UUnet and other
providers to be flooded due to the large traffic shifts.

If you have problems reaching specific sites please send an email to
noc@internap.com containing a traceroute and source/destination IP
addresses and we will investigate.  If it is possible will will attempt to
move specific prefixes onto an alternate provider leaving an Internap PNAP
if that will provide better performance.

Regards,
Andrew

UUnet is currently experiencing a large number of problems in their North
American backbone.  Internap has been aware of these problems since approx
06:00 PST.  Most of the problems appear to be concentrated on the East
Coast but we have reports of problems from other geographic regions.

This is being tracked under Internap ticket 106448 and UUnet master ticket
651751.

UUnet currently does not have any ETA for a fix for this event.

If you have issues reaching a specific site please send an email to
noc@internap.com with a traceroute showing the path which has a problem.

Internap has shutdown peerings to UUnet is various cities to help reduce
the number of problems that customers will experience.

Regards,
Andrew

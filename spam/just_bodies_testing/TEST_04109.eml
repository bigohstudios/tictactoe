Interesting.  This is the opposite of my experience, where I started friends
out on Ubuntu as a way to break them into Linux but they found the amount of
updates annoying, and there were some instability issues at different
times.  So I switched them to Lenny - sure it took a little more to set up,
but now it is *set up* and stays that way, unlike my/their experiences with
Ubuntu.  It's pretty much zero maintenance for me, unlike when they had
Ubuntu on their computers.  5 updates a week, if that many?  I'll take it.

Plus, if I can use a non-company based OS that won't install, for example,
Ubuntu One, without my choice to not install it, I'll choose that path.  I
was kinda disappointed to see Ubuntu starting to include bloatware in their
last few releases, just my experience though.

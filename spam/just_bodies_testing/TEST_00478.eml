Does it annoy anyone else that the 'aptitude' package no longer provides an=
=20
'aptitude' binary?

Typing 'aptitude-curses' is a little annoying.  I'm assuming the rename is=
=20
because of work on aptitude-gtk and aptitude-qt.  If so, wouldn't using the=
=20
alternatives system for an 'aptitude' symlink make sense?

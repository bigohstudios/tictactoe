 What good is a great concept (Roth conversion) without a turnkey system
to sell it?	
 	



Introducing the Roth Conversion turnkey selling system

Our top producing roth conversion agent (sold 10 jumbo annuities, 200k
sales with 14%+ commissions) has shared with us his secrets of selling
the roth conversion concept. Per his input, we have created the roth
conversion "turnkey sales process".

The system includes client postcards, client brochures, a client
worksheet (perfect for introducing the roth conversion program), a full
marketing presentation, etc. If he can do it, so can you!

To join us for the brand new "sales presentation" teleconference, call

I'm using Simple DNS from JHSoft.  We support only a few web sites and =
I'd like to swap secondary services with someone in a similar position.

We have a static IP, DSL line and a 24/7 set of web, SQL, mail and now a =
DNS server.  As I said, we are hosting about 10 web sites, web and DNS =
traffic is almost nothing.  Everything is on lightly loaded APC battery =
backups so we are very seldom down.

I'd like to swap with someone also using Simple DNS to take advantage of =
the trusted zone file transfer option.

I've done this.  It's not as pretty as I think it should be, but it works.  
I'm going to leave the cosmetic issues to others.  When I update the 
documentation, I'll add this to the exmh.TODO file.

I'm leaving for a 2 1/2 week vacation in a week, so this is the last new 
functionality I'm going to add for a while.  Also, I now have pretty much 
everything in there that I want for my own use, so I'm probably pretty much 
done.  I'll work on bug fixes and documentation before my vacation, and 
hopefully do nothing more afterwards.

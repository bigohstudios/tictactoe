Hi,

I have many media files in some specific directory (folder, call it as
you want). Loading the folder takes ~30 sec., even if I am using quite
fast HDDs, etc. They're all on the same partition. I have disabled
previewing, or thumbnails.

How can I do to make this process faster?

Thanks.

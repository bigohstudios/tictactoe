Like others have said, this is a device naming issue. In order to boot=20
you must fix your fstab, preferably to use something else than device=20
names. Labels are easier to set up by hand IMO.

After that you have to make sure the 'root=3D' parameter in grub is=20
correct. The easiest way is to 'e' (edit) the respective line at the=20
grub boot menu and experiment until you find the correct device name.

I think that is deprecated since a long time (probably since udev is=20
around).

A new kernel could help only if it assigns the same device names as you=20
have in menu.lst/fstab, but I think it's the bad approach.

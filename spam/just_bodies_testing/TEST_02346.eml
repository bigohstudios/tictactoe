I installed apt-get yesterday and liked it, for a couple hours anyway.=20
Late last night I started to get errors like:


--( root@theshadows )-- apt-get update
E: Method http has died unexpectedly!
E: Tried to dequeue a fetching object
E: Tried to dequeue a fetching object
E: Tried to dequeue a fetching object
E: Tried to dequeue a fetching object
E: Tried to dequeue a fetching object
E: Tried to dequeue a fetching object
E: Tried to dequeue a fetching object
(...)

i get the same errors (two like the first line instead of one) with
apt-get update.

I was wondering why this would happen.

I would appreciate any help you all can give me.

Thanks.

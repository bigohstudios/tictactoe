I just checked out b2_4_0 from CVS and 'make test' fails horribly.

It seems to be looking in my site_perl SpamAssassin code, not the build
directory.

Example error:

Failed to run FROM_AND_TO_SAME_5 SpamAssassin test, skipping:
        (Can't locate object method "check_for_from_to_same" via package
"Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" at
/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm line
1701.
)

Anyone else seeing this?

rOD.

How about this instead of the last paragraph:

---
Please note that the Security Team does not monitor unstable. It is up=20
to the individual maintainer to fix the issue. This may under=20
circumstances take longer, e.g. if the maintainer is waiting for a new=20
version from upstream. There are also no Debian Security Advisories=20
(DSA) for issues that are present in the unstable version of a software,=20
but not the versions in stable and/or testing.

Aoki-san, what do you think, is this getting too long? I also thought=20
about mentioning alternate sources to get security informations (CVEs=20
and such).

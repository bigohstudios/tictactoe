Note you need to install kdb in place of console-tools to
use large fonts.

[/etc/default/console-setup]
VERBOSE_OUTPUT=3D"yes"
ACTIVE_CONSOLES=3D"/dev/tty[1-6]"
CHARMAP=3D"UTF-8"
CODESET=3D"Uni3"
#FONTFACE=3DVGA
FONTFACE=3D"TerminusBold"
FONTSIZE=3D"32x16"
if [ -f /etc/default/keyboard ]; then
    . /etc/default/keyboard
fi

This gives a fairly nice large font on the console.  The VGA
font is blockier but replicates the 8x16 VGA font faithfully.
It would be nice if one could automatically create a
console font automatically from a TTF/OTF font such as
DejaVu Sans Mono, which would really look the part.

Other potential fonts.  Note, you only get some in
particular encodings.  Lat15 and Uni1/3 are OK for
most Latin usage.  I'm using Uni3 because it has some
useful symbols in addition to the main alphabetical
chars.
% ls /usr/share/consolefonts | grep 32 | egrep 'Lat15|Uni'
Lat15-Terminus32x16.psf.gz
Lat15-TerminusBold32x16.psf.gz
Lat15-VGA32x16.psf.gz
Uni1-VGA32x16.psf.gz
Uni2-Terminus32x16.psf.gz
Uni2-TerminusBold32x16.psf.gz
Uni2-VGA32x16.psf.gz
Uni3-Terminus32x16.psf.gz
Uni3-TerminusBold32x16.psf.gz

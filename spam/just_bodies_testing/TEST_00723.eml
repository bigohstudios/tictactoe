NIS: /etc/nsswitch seems (a bit) ignored from /usr/bin/passwdFrom nobody Sat Jul 20 14:17:28 2013

hi,

I have a real strange problem. We have a NIS system with Debian Lenny
clients and LDAP as second system, but LDAP is not the problem here. I
want, that the user have to use the passwd command (cause of cracklib
support via pam). Here some facts on one client:

/etc/nsswitch.conf

passwd: file nis
shadow: files
group: files nis

/etc/passwd

[...]
testck:x:6290:4000:test test:/home/testck:/bin/bash
+:::::::::
[...]

Shadow passes are disabled.

/etc/pam.d/common-password

password   required  pam_unix.so nullok md5 nis debug

I can do:

getent passwd | grep testck

testck:x:6290:4000:test test:/home/testck:/bin/bash
testck:[md5 hash]:6290:4000:test test:/home/testck:/bin/bash

You see, user testck is listed twice. One of /etc/passwd, one from
another location, nis.

So, the main problem is, if the user wants to change the password,
passwd breaks immediately, after asking the Old Password, however, NIS
isn't involved ...=20

If I remove the testck from the local /etc/passwd, getent list only the
nis one (cool), but, "su - testck" doesn't work anymore. the user is
unknown.

I' don't know, why the users are listed in the local /etc/passwd file,
I'm new to the system, but it looks a bit strange to me.

( i tested everything without reboot)

So, the main problem is, that passwd breaks cause of the missing
password in /etc/passwd and passwd doesn't look in the the NIS map,
where the password resides.

any suggestions?

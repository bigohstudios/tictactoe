I used Etch on my desktop and Laptop for quite a while with little to no lo=
ss=20
of functionality.  I don't really understand why you think you need the lat=
est=20
release.  I want well-tested software so I can use it instead of fix it or=
=20
wait until it gets fixed.  I also want stable software so I'm not having to=
=20
relearn a UI every week or so.

Now, I currently run a mixed system on both my desktop and laptop.  It=20
includes packages from Lenny, testing, and Sid.  I originally did this to b=
e=20
able to use KDE SC 4.2.  I am hoping that I can switch back to using stable=
=20
Debian for both the desktop and laptop once Squeeze is released.

I also use Debian on a number of servers.  I enable a mixed system there as=
=20
well, but I have yet to need to pull any packages from testing or Sid.

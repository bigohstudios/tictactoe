It was written in the days of the sarge freeze and is entirely
focused on sarge.

Interesting analysis. ;)

I /wanted/ to focus on Debian and leave out the "core stuff of
Unix/Linux" and "common computing tasks", because that's documented
elsewhere.

It is true that in the last 5 years, some parts have been obsoleted,
but I'd say most of it still applies.

Regardless, there's a need for a new edition. I am working on it.

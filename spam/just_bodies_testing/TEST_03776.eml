IMHO, it is a good idea to implement LVM when possible.
In case you go on, I recently went through an actual BTDT situation:

Having /tmp mounted noexec,nosuid for security reasons, aptitude
failed to execute postinstall scripts.
The solution was to remount exec /tmp partition and rerun aptitude.
After that I had to add this to /etc/apt/apt.conf or under
/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/ (depends on your config)

DPkg::Pre-Invoke{"mount -o remount,exec /tmp";};                           =
                                                                       =20
DPkg::Post-Invoke {"mount -o remount /tmp";}; =20

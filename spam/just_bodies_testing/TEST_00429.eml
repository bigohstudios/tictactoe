I found a nice little Perl script for this purpose called rotate, which 
makes the process of rotating log files very simple.  If there's an 
official source for this script, I couldn't find it.  (My hosting 
provider, pair.com, has it installed, and that's where I found it.) 
 However, redistribution appears to be allowed, so I've attached it.

Good luck...

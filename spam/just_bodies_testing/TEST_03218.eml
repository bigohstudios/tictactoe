Ok, I wasn't specific enough.  Sorry about that.

What I meant with "doesn't work" is: it doesn't load the symbols.

I have now tried "gdb /usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/kmail <pid>", and this gives m=
e=20
the symbols for the main binary (and if pwd is ok or I add "-d <path>" to=20
the cmdline, it even shows the source code, so that's fine, too), but for=20
all the shared libraries, I'm still stuck.

add-symbol-file wants an address (where would I get this?); plain "symbol-
file" crashes gdb (and in any case: wouldn't this *replace* the symbol tabl=
e=20
instead of add to it?)


cheers

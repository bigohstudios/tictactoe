Yes. interfaces(5) will tell you all you need for the configuration=20
part, but before you send the drive don't forget to delete=20
/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules. This is the file responsible=20
for mapping network interfaces to names by MAC. Wired interfaces are=20
called eth0, eth1 and so on. Pray she doesn't have more than one=20
(including any firewire adapter) otherwise it can get tricky.

Could be. The newer installer will setup fstab with UUIDs, but don't=20
know about 5.0.4 (lenny). You can still modify it yourself though. Use=20
blkid(8) (package util-linux) to find out the UUIDs and replace

/dev/hda1	/	ext3	errors=3Dremount-ro	0	1

with

UUID=3D<realy long hex string that is the UUID>	/	ext3	errors=3Dremount-ro	=
0	1

(assuming /dev/hda1 is the root partition)

Grub (the boot loader) can also be an issue, especially since its 'root'=20
parameter can not use LABEL or UUID. If this is the only drive in the=20
computer and the root partition is the first one you probably need

root	(hd0,0)

and you also need to pass the correct UUID as a kernel parameter. =20
Replace 'root=3D/dev/hda1' with 'root=3DUUID=3D<the very long hex string>.

Do not edit the stanzas directly, but read the comments at the beginning=20
of the file. You have to edit (from memory) the 'groot' and 'kopt'=20
parameters, after which you have to run 'update-grub'.

Hope I didn't miss anything. There was also recently a thread about=20
this, you should look it up.

It depends.
One possible way would be to check every single application (and potentiall=
y=20
their plugins) for PIM related functionality.
I guess it is just easier to depend on runtime. These processes are run on-
demand only anyway, so in the worst case they consume disk space if nothing=
 is=20
actually using PIM functionality.

Ah, right. Probably a KRunner plugin for actions on contacts.

Ah, good research, thank you!

I think the preconfigured threshold for database cached parts is 4KB, thoug=
h=20
there can be several such parts per item (depends on the data type).

Right, again in in the 4.4 context.
With emails these can easily be surpassed, especially on update rate (mails=
=20
come in, get marked read, moved, deleted, etc)

My take is that there is quite some room for optimizations through input by=
=20
people with good knowledge of database systems.
As far as I know the developers had help from some MySQL expert on the init=
ial=20
configuration, but since MySQL evolves over time the chosen settings might =
not=20
be that good anymore.

SQLite wasn't viable until very recently due to deadlocking when transactio=
ns=20
were being using in a multithreading environment.
My most up-to-date information on that is that it mostly works now with a=20
development version of SQLite and some additional changes elsewhere.
IIRC there is only one deadlock case left.

Performance wise it might be a viable solution for people with low=20
requirements on PIM, e.g. not for people like myself with several hundret=20
thousand mails, tens of quite active mailinglist, etc. :)

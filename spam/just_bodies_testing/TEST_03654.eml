Real Time Programming for Embedded Systems:

This course is ideal for engineers who are new to the field of real-time. =
It is also applicable to both managers and engineers who are considering =
the use of Real-Time Operating Systems on future projects=2E

Objective:

=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Appreciate the use of multitasking techniques in =
real-time systems.=A0
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Understand the fundamental concepts of real-time =
operating systems.=A0
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Understand the features and structures of =
practical implementations.=A0
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Appreciate how application areas (e.g. =
safety-critical, desktop, etc.) impact on RTOS facilities.=A0

Suitable for:

This course is ideal for engineers who are new to the field of real-time. =
It is also applicable to both managers and engineers who are considering =
the use of Real-Time Operating Systems on future projects=2E

Pre-requisites:

=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Knowledge of a high level language (e.g. C, C++, =
etc.)=A0
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 An understanding of the fundamentals of =
computer-based systems

Embedded C for System Developers:

In this course you'll learn advanced programming techniques using dynamic =
data structures and algorithms. Finite state machines and statecharts and =
their uses are covered in depth. You'll also learn techniques specific to =
embedded systems, such as structured interrupt handling, implementation of =
simple schedulers, and how to work with embedded operating systems. You'll =
learn the standard inter-process communication mechanisms and their uses. =
In addition the course overviews various advanced algorithms and discusses =
research oriented approaches for learning more about these algorithms and =
their implementation. The course will also show you how to design modules =
with clean interfaces to achieve disciplined and well structured code=2E

The course emphasizes the implementation of disciplined and well =
structured code and the design of modules with clean interfaces. Lab =
exercises are used to consolidate key concepts=2E


Prerequisites


Attendees should have some experience of embedded systems programming and =
a sound basic knowledge of the C languageDelivery

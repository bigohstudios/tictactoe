I selected "n" and then "y" and it downgraded the packages to testing. Why
would they have been upgraded in the first place? Here is my sources file:

stuckey@debian:~$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list
deb ftp://ftp.debian-multimedia.org squeeze main non-free

deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main contrib non-free
#deb-src http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main contrib non-free

#deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian sid main contrib non-free
deb-src http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/ sid main contrib non-free

deb http://security.debian.org/ squeeze/updates main contrib non-free

So have I.  I didn't mean to imply otherwise.  I looked at them for decidin=
g=20
on reiserfs, then I replicated the results on my own hardware using bonnie+=
+=20
before restoring my backups.

I also look around for results about once a year, to see if much has change=
d,=20
or if there are new file systems I should look at.  Less often, I'll try an=
d=20
run my own bonnie++ tests, but not rigorously; they occur on my system unde=
r=20
whatever load I happen to be running.

Trust, but verify.

That's not a theory; or that least it is not hypothetical.  It's proven tru=

desktop applications.

Took me a little while, but I see bug-fix patches from this year.  It's not=

These have significant overhead over file system-specific methods.  They ar=
e=20
the both universal and fairly conservative, so your advocacy is well-
justified.  It's also pretty easy to do them wrong, or get a poorly perform=

file system out of them.  It's easy to forget extended attributes and  ACLs=

when using cp/tar/rsync; there may be other file system data that needs to =

preserved, too (HPFS+ forks?).  Taking a kernel tarball from a ext3 file=20

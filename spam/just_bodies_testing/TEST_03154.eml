Well, that depends. When you have a fine app, tuning is good. However,
when you make a new app, or think your app needs UI improvements, then
you need to change stuff. Linux is not the same as Windows, which Linux
is blamed for by some Windows enthusiasts. For me it is a good thing: if
I want something similar to Windows, well, I use Windows.
I think this is kind of the same situation. KDE 3.5 has its strengths
and weaknesses. In order to reduce the amount of weaknesses, the devs
thought a change was needed. KDE 3.5 also had some eye candy, most of it
useless from the point of view of usability. Improvements like
alt-tabbing trough screens where they are showed in some sort of stack
is very useful to me, as you can quickly see which window you want.

Konqueror apparently got some TLC in 4.4, however I also regret that
change. The ram usage of kde is not a problem to me, but then I have 4GB
of it ;)

Well, useful eye candy, the search function in the menu, the ability to
place widgets on the desktop and not only the taskbar. Also, for me it
feels faster when it is running. KDE 3.5 sometimes was lagging. It might
very well be that KDE 4 is hiding the lag behind eye candy, but it is
about the feel, isn't it?
Also, kile got improved a lot, I like the new mount dock thingy (I hated
the annoying popups). Should I go on?

Anyway, opinions differ. And that's of course what FOSS is all about:
choice!

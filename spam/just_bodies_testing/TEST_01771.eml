The overclockers have given it another jolt, perhaps to potential sales 
(and maybe sales of liquid nitrogen):

*English Summary*

When the Intel Pentium 4 2,8GHz CPU arrived to our testlab we ordered 10 
liters of Liquid Nitrogen (LN2 -196∞C) and decided to run some tests in 
very low temperatures.

After some adjusting and testing we were able to run SiSoft Sandra CPU 
and Memory benchmarks and Pifast benchmark smoothly when the CPU was 
running at 3917MHz. We raised the FSB one more step and managed to run 
succesfully SuperPi benchmark while CPU was running at 3998MHz. The 
result was 39 seconds.

Test setup: P4 2,8GHz, Modified Asus P4T533-C, Samsung PC800 RDRAM, PNY 
GeForce 4 MX440 and Windows XP OS.

Check out the pictures.

I have such a system.  It works like this :
    1)  sa-exim scans the message during the SMTP interaction
    2)  if it scores high enough it is rejected
        2.1)    if it is rejected, exim mentions that in the reject log
        2.2)    if it isn't rejected it is delivered
            2.2.1)  it is up to the user to deal with (filter as
                    desired) the lower-scoring spam
    3)  I have a script run as a daily cron job to run through the
        reject log and deposit a report in the user's home directory
        indicating what was rejected and way (SA isn't the only cause
        for rejection)

Obviously my setup is rather tied to exim and sa-exim, but if you want
the reporting script I can send it to you.

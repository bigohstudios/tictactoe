Hello list=2C

I was wondering if anyone could suggest a package or means to look at any o=
r all of the information from a given executable binary file:

- What compiler compiled it

- What (source) language was it compiled from

- What computer architecture the file was compiled for

- How many hardware bits was the file intended for (eg. 32-bit or 64-bit en=
coding)

- Endianness


If any of the above a simply not possible because of the nature all binary =
files=2C it would be helpful to know that too.

Thanks.

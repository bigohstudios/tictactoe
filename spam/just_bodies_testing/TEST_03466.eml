Dear Dr. Ban,

It is my pleasure to inform you about the latest developments to The =
Computer=20
Journal=20
(http://sci.scientific-direct.net/c.asp?814748&41248fb1d7ff79fc&11),=20
which has enjoyed a doubling in submissions since I started as =
Editor-in-Chief in 2008.

New Sections
In recent years, the journal has seen major growth in its readership and =
Impact Factor as=20
a result of our choice to expand the scope and renew its editorial =
board. As a first step,=20
the journal divided into two sections in 2009:=20

- Section A - Computer Science, Methods and Tools

- Section B - Networks and Computer Systems.

The massive growth in submissions allowed us first to go from 6 to 8 =
issues in 2009,=20
and now allows us to increase the journal's size once again in 2010 from =
8 to 10=20
issues per year while also strengthening its high selectivity, and to =
add a new section:=20

- Section C: Computational Intelligence.

New Look
The Computer Journal will also have a new look which goes in line with =
the=20
re-branding of the British Computer Society. The re-designed cover shown =

above will be implemented from 2010.

International Editorial Board
The Editorial Board has been renewed and enlarged to include new members =

from Europe, Asia and North America. This reflects the journal's status =
as a truly=20
international enterprise - with over 90% of submissions and =
institutional subscriptions=20
now coming from outside the UK.

Computer science is constantly evolving and The Computer Journal
will reflect this by continuing to explore new opportunities as they =
arise. For more=20

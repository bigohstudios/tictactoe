I have confirmed one of the Smart Upgrades contained in debian-multimedia on
Lenny does in fact cause this Fatal Error.  I reinstalled Lenny on the same
machine tonight, without adding debian-multimedia to /etc/apt/sources.list,
and mplayer plays the .mov files just fine.

Wanted to share in case anyone else has this problem.

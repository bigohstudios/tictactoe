Sure thing :)

I've added to the spec some flags to remove OSS and ISA-PNP support at
build time if one wishes to, so is's possible to do a

	rpmbuild --recompile <rpm> --without oss --without isapnp

(I haven't included OSS in my 2.4.19, because VT82433 on my motherboard
is not supported :( yet, and I'm too lazy to recompile the kernel :)).

Also, having the kernel compiled by me, I have no kernel-source package
installed.  I've added a flag "kernsrc", that also can be used
--without, to remove the dependency for kernel-source at build time.  It
would be nice to check the correct kernel include files actually exist
(/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/linux/*.h), though; however, I'm
a beginner in RPM building -- is it possible to BuildRequire for a file
not provided by a package at all?  I've googled a bit, and found no way
to do that.

I was also considering adding some sort of flag for the --with-cards
option in alsa's ./configure, but don't know how to do that.  Only found
out about --without from your first alsa-driver.spec, and existing RPM docs 
don't help much.


Oh, and one more thing :).  At first I've installed the first version of
alsa-driver for 2.4.18-10, although I don't have that kernel, to supply
the dependency for the rest of the alsa rpm's, and compiled the modules
from source.  It created the /dev files and all.

Then wanted to make my own rpm for 2.4.19, so now I'm trying to rpmbuild
the alsa-kernel package.  Removed all alsa rpms, and tried my spec:

rpmbuild --ba alsa-driver.spec.mine --without oss --without isapnp
--without kernsrc

But I get this:

Like I said, I'm a beginned with RPM building, so I don't understand
much of what's going on here.  The 00macros file is from the MAKEDEV
rpm, and alsasound was supposed to be installed by alsa-driver, I think.
   It is not in the filesystem, anyway.

I've looked in /var/tmp/alsa-driver-0.9.0rc3-root, they are there in
etc.  For 00macros I think the part that does it is this line
in alsa-driver.spec:

cp -a %{_sysconfdir}/makedev.d/00macros /{buildroot}%{_sysconfdir}/makedev.d/

And alsasound is installed by %{BUILDIDR}/Makefile.


Oh, and I think I've forgot to mention, I'm running beta-null :).

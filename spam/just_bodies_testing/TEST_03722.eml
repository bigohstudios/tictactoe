Interesting. I've had the browser crash, but not upon loading any and
every flash site with the 64-bit plugin. I am running Chromium dev as
well as Sid, but other than that, I couldn't tell you. Flash does crash
my browser (actually, I've had Chromium itself reboot my system), but it
has been no more frequent or infrequent that when I was using the 32-bit
plugin.

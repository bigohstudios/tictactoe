wicd used to conflict with network-manager, but not anymore:

wicd (1.6.2.2-2) unstable; urgency=3Dlow

  [...]
  * debian/control:
    - remove Conflict on network-manager, since both can be used at
      the same time, provided they don't try to control the same
      interface (Closes: #548978)

There may be valid use cases for this.

You could file a whishlist bug on these:

$ aptitude search '?recommends(network-manager-kde)'
p   education-standalone                                               - De=
bian Edu standalone workstation packages                                  =
=20
p   kde-standard                                                       - th=
e KDE Plasma Desktop and standard set of applications                     =
=20
p   knm-runtime                                                        - KD=
E NetworkManagement infrastructure runtime files                          =
=20
p   network-manager                                                    - ne=
twork management framework daemon                                         =
=20

so they

Recommend: network-manager-kde | wicd-gtk

Unfortunately there is no wicd-qt package and I doubt the KDE=20
maintainers will want to 'Recommend' a GTK package, especially since it=20
isn't that hard to override.

I agree with you, but in this particular case it is not a 'Depends' it=20
is a 'Recommends', and testing/unstable users should know how to=20
override those.

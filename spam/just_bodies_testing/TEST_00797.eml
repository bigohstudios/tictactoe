It's generally referred to as a "mixed" system.  Most "mixed" systems are=20
neither tested nor officially supported.  They can still be quite useful.

Adding backports as a source is *almost* supported.  Backports is not an=20
official service for Lenny, but I think there was some work to make it=20
official for Squeeze or Squeeze+1.

In practice, using stable/backports is _vastly_ superior to trying to use a=
=20
mixed stable/testing system.  Unless you've already been playing with pinni=
ng,=20
you should simply be able to add backports to your sources.list.  Only the=
=20
packages you specifically request from backports will be installed.

The order the lines appear in the file does not affect what versions of a=20
package will be installed.  (It *might* affect which mirror is tried first,=
=20
but I don't think even that is guaranteed.)

You'll want to look into (man 5 apt_preferences) if you want to run a mixed=
=20
system.  I also have some information at=20

You should probably know how to do this before you consider moving to a mix=
ed=20
system.  There's (aptitude -t testing hpijs-ppds) and (aptitude hpijs-
ppds/testing) which seem fairly similar but can do very different things.

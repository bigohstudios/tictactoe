It may have pulling in some dependencies from Sid, then.

I know the official line is to use '-t $something' as arguments to apt-
get/aptitude for pulling in packages from Sid/experimental/backports, but I=
=20
think it is better to use the '$package=3D$version' format.  (After getting=
 the=20
version from something like (apt-cache policy $package).)

My instinct is that '-t $something' effectively increases the priority of a=
ll=20
packages from the $something repository, which may make the dependency=20
resolver pull more from that repository than is absolutely necessary.

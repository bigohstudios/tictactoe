Following that reasoning, I've been installing all my custom-built
kernels through rpm recently. I find it annoying, though, that 
alsa-kernel, and similar packages, will only build for the currently 
running kernel.

So I've attached a patch to specify an alternate kernel by setting the
"TARGET_KERNEL" environment variable before running rpmbuild. You
still need to have the rpm for the specified kernel installed, but at
least it doesn't have to be currently running. It's kinda hackish, so
if someone has a better way to do this, let me know.

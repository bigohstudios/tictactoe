Hi -=20

I upgraded to 2.40 (now 2.41) last week and the messages which are =
definitely in the DCC database aren't being marked as such by =
spamassassin when connected to via spamc. Interestingly it is detected =
when running spamassassin -t < sample-spam.txt (using the same userid =
incidentally). Is this a known "feature" of spamc under 2.4x or is there =
anything obvious that I am not implementing correctly? Note that as I =
implied above this used to work under 2.3x of spamassassin and =
spamd/spamc

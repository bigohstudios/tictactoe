[ILUG] Do NOT Drop your Life InsuranceDear ilug@linux.ie 

Life Partners are life insurance appraisers that appraise all types of life insurance policies, allowing people to access their life insurance cash now rather than later. We help individuals unlock cash from unutilized assets. 
Individuals usually age 65 or older who find that their health, financial and/or estate planning needs have changed are typical candidates. We have had some candidates advised by financial planners to drop their life insurance policies so they could invest their money in a vehicle that will make them a return now. DO NOT drop your policy as it may be worth CASH to you NOW.

Why do people sell their policies? 
The reasons individuals make the decision to sell their life insurance policies are as varied as the people themselves. Some reasons may be to:

Pay off debts 
Fund long term care insurance cost 
Eliminate costly premiums 
Take advantage of other financial opportunities 
Make charitable contributions 
Help family members

Re: Hi how to escaping under ` ` in shFrom nobody Sat Jul 20 14:17:30 2013

Try

`mysql -u root -pmy\\\$qlPW -N -B -e 'show databases'`

I think that's right. Escape the $ so it doesn't get processed by the
current shell, escape the slash so it doesn't get processed, falls to \$
which then re-escapes the $ for passing into mysql as part of your password.

Nick is on to something as well, this should also work:

`mysql -u root -p 'my\$qlPW' -N -B -e 'show databases'`

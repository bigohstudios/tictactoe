Generally, people don't. Only the minimum minimorum (strict minimum)
needs to be connected to the UPS' electrical outlets. Mine has two rows
of electrical outlets: one which is `only' secured, and the other which
is connected to the battery. The best idea is to not succumb to the
tentation of plugging every possible electrical device into the
battery-connected electrical outlets. But reasonable thoughts need to be
taken into account in this case. I saw people having the screen plugged
in the battery, but the main unit being plugged into the not-battery
row. This is complete nonsense, and a total lack of commonsense.

Sure. But scanners do.

 I started looking in this direction myself last night. I am, for the life
of me, unable to figure why or how drives are designated as early versus
non-early. With the exception of adding "noearly" to the options in
/etc/cryptab. However, I am unable to find a single partition on a single
encrypted machine that uses this option. So theoretically, all of the drives
should be designated as early. I also haven't done this in a couple of
years, so maybe the encryption system has matured in the meantime.

I'm really not comfortable with modifying something like that, not because I
can't, but rather because I don't want to tweak something and have it break
on the next upgrade. So I will take the latter suggestion. I want to build a
test box to see if I can further troubleshoot the problem or if it still
even exists.

Thanks for the suggestions, thib...

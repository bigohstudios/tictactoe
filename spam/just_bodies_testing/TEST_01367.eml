fifo is just like pipe, but there is a name/filesystem entry for that.  you
could assume that fifo is splitting the standard
program1 | programs into two parts using the named fifo.

In this case it depends how your program is doing the processing, whether it
processes one file each after downloading or at once after downloading them
all.

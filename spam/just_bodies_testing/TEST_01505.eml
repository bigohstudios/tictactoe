In my humble opinion, this statement holds true if you keep the "original"
Windows that came with your laptop.  Usually this Windows is slighly
modified or has a special power manager or management options made by the
laptop manufacturer, specially tailored for the laptop model.  I wish they
would also make available similar configurations for non-Windows OS (for
example, as configuration files/scripts for laptop-mode-tools or others)

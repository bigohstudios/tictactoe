The Lenny kernel is configured with POSIX ACL support for ext2/3/4dev and=20
generic ACL support.  I don't think you'll need to patch the kernel, but I=

XFS is mature, fast, and well-supported by the kernel team.  If your system=
 is=20
subject to unclean shutdowns (e.g. power failure w/o a UPS), you might want=
 to=20
tune your system to flush the XFS cache to disk a bit more often than the=20
defaults.

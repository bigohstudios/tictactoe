Downgrading is not supported. Changing the apt-config just means that=20
the apt-files don't reflect the state of your system (as mentioned=20
elsewhere in this thread). It will *not* fix your problem.
You can of course uninstall the package and reinstall a previous version =

directly from its deb. To get that deb, you can use snapshot.debian.org=20
or get it from the testing or stable repos.

When exactly you need to press Control-C? After exiting the remote
node? Before? I'd really need to look at the script you are using, the
one produced by the autoexpect session, but you could try either sending=20
an extra `exit' string or sending a control-C (send \003)
Take a look here=B9 for more ASCII Control Characters.

Regarding the second part, the way you automate the task can't be
really called _scheduling_, (i.e., a script will be executed every
Sunday at 13:00). That is _iteration_, your script will be executed
five times in a row. But I think you know better than me what you want to=
=20
accomplish with it.

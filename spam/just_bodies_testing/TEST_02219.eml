Assuming it's my fault (which it probably is since nobody else has really been 
in there), it's most likely related to the number of sequences in a folder.  
I'd guess that something is either being called that shouldn't be or is being 
called more times than it should be.

Not that I'm aware of.  If you look in the code, there are various places 
where the time function is called in order to see how long it took to do 
things.  You'll probably want to borrow that technique.

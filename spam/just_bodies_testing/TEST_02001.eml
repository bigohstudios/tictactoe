Odd.  I only see that happening if you already had belocs-locales-data=20
installed:
bss@rei:~% aptitude why evolution belocs-locales-bin
p   evolution           Depends  libc6 (>=3D 2.7-1)
i A libc6               Suggests locales
i A belocs-locales-data Provides locales
i A belocs-locales-data Depends  belocs-locales-bin
bss@rei:~% aptitude why-not evolution locales
p   evolution           Depends   libc6 (>=3D 2.7-1)
i A libc6               Suggests  locales
i A belocs-locales-data Provides  locales
i A belocs-locales-data Conflicts locales
bss@rei:~%

I'm betting you should be able to move back to locales instead of belocs-
locales-bin; have you tried?
